Workflows allow you to define a series of steps to guide Cline through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or submitting a PR.

To invoke a workflow, type `/[workflow-name.md]` in the chat.

## How to Create and Use Workflows

Workflows live alongside Cline Rules. Creating one is straightforward:

<Frame>
	<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cline_public_images/docs/assets/workflows.png" alt="Workflows tab in Cline" />
</Frame>

1. Create a markdown file with clear instructions for the steps Cline should take
2. Save it with a `.md` extension in your workflows directory
3. To trigger a workflow, just type `/` followed by the workflow filename
4. Provide any required parameters when prompted

The real power comes from how you structure your workflow files. You can:

-   Leverage Cline's built-in tools like `ask_followup_question`, `read_file`, and `search_files`
-   Use command-line tools you already have installed like `gh` or `docker`
-   Reference external MCP tool calls like Slack or Whatsapp
-   Chain multiple actions together in a specific sequence

## Real-world Example

I created a PR Review workflow that's already saving me tons of time.

````md pr-review.md [expandable]
You have access to the `gh` terminal command. I already authenticated it for you. Please review it to use the PR that I asked you to review. You're already in the `cline` repo.

# GitHub PR Review Process - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## 1. Gather PR Information

1. Get the PR title, description, and comments:

    ```bash
    gh pr view <PR-number> --json title,body,comments
    ```

2. Get the full diff of the PR:
    ```bash
    gh pr diff <PR-number>
    ```

## 2. Understand the Context

1. Identify which files were modified in the PR:

    ```bash
    gh pr view <PR-number> --json files
    ```

2. Examine the original files in the main branch to understand the context:

    ```xml
    <read_file>
    <path>path/to/file</path>
    </read_file>
    ```

3. For specific sections of a file, you can use search_files:
    ```xml
    <search_files>
    <path>path/to/directory</path>
    <regex>search term</regex>
    <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
    </search_files>
    ```

## 3. Analyze the Changes

1. For each modified file, understand:

    - What was changed
    - Why it was changed (based on PR description)
    - How it affects the codebase
    - Potential side effects

2. Look for:
    - Code quality issues
    - Potential bugs
    - Performance implications
    - Security concerns
    - Test coverage

## 4. Ask for User Confirmation

1. Before making a decision, ask the user if you should approve the PR, providing your assessment and justification:

    ```xml
    <ask_followup_question>
    <question>Based on my review of PR #<PR-number>, I recommend [approving/requesting changes]. Here's my justification:

    [Detailed justification with key points about the PR quality, implementation, and any concerns]

    Would you like me to proceed with this recommendation?</question>
    <options>["Yes, approve the PR", "Yes, request changes", "No, I'd like to discuss further"]</options>
    </ask_followup_question>
    ```

## 5. Ask if User Wants a Comment Drafted

1. After the user decides on approval/rejection, ask if they would like a comment drafted:

    ```xml
    <ask_followup_question>
    <question>Would you like me to draft a comment for this PR that you can copy and paste?</question>
    <options>["Yes, please draft a comment", "No, I'll handle the comment myself"]</options>
    </ask_followup_question>
    ```

2. If the user wants a comment drafted, provide a well-structured comment they can copy:

    ```
    Thank you for this PR! Here's my assessment:

    [Detailed assessment with key points about the PR quality, implementation, and any suggestions]

    [Include specific feedback on code quality, functionality, and testing]
    ```

## 6. Make a Decision

1. Approve the PR if it meets quality standards:

    ```bash
    gh pr review <PR-number> --approve --body "Your approval message"
    ```

2. Request changes if improvements are needed:
    ```bash
    gh pr review <PR-number> --request-changes --body "Your feedback message"
    ```
    </detailed_sequence_of_steps>

# Example PR Review Process

Let's walk through a real example of reviewing PR #3627 which fixes the thinking mode calculation for Claude 3.7 models.

## Step 1: Gather PR Information

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view 3627 --json title,body,comments

# Get the full diff
gh pr diff 3627
```

## Step 2: Understand the Context

```xml
# Examine the original files to understand what's being changed
<read_file>
<path>src/shared/api.ts</path>
</read_file>

# Look at the ThinkingBudgetSlider component implementation
<read_file>
<path>webview-ui/src/components/settings/ThinkingBudgetSlider.tsx</path>
</read_file>

# Check how thinking mode is currently handled in API providers
<search_files>
<path>src/api/providers</path>
<regex>reasoningOn</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

## Step 3: Analyze the Changes

From the PR information and code examination, we can see that:

1. The PR fixes an issue with the thinking mode budget calculation for Claude 3.7 models
2. Currently, the thinking budget is incorrectly calculated as 80% of maxTokens (8192), resulting in 6553 tokens
3. Claude 3.7 actually supports a much larger thinking budget (up to 64000 tokens)
4. The PR adds a `thinkingConfig` property with `maxBudget: 64000` to model definitions
5. It updates API handlers to use this value when reasoning mode is enabled
6. It enhances the slider component to calculate max values based on model-specific percentages
7. Comprehensive tests were added to verify the calculations

## Step 4: Ask for User Confirmation

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Based on my review of PR #3627, I recommend approving this PR. Here's my justification:

1. The PR correctly fixes the thinking mode budget calculation for Claude 3.7 models
2. It properly implements the thinkingConfig.maxBudget property (64000) for Claude 3.7 models
3. It applies the appropriate percentage (50%) for the slider calculation
4. The changes are well-tested with comprehensive unit tests
5. The implementation is clean and follows the project's coding standards
6. The PR includes helpful screenshots demonstrating the fix

Would you like me to proceed with approving this PR?</question>
<options>["Yes, approve the PR", "No, I'd like to discuss further", "Let me review it myself first"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 5: Ask if User Wants a Comment Drafted

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Would you like me to draft a comment for this PR that you can copy and paste?</question>
<options>["Yes, please draft a comment", "No, I'll handle the comment myself"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

## Step 6: Make a Decision

```bash
gh pr review 3627 --approve --body "This PR looks good! It correctly fixes the thinking mode budget calculation for Claude 3.7 models by using the appropriate maxBudget value (64000) and applying the right percentage (50%) for the slider. The changes are well-tested and the implementation is clean."
```

When I get a new PR to review, I used to manually gather context: checking the PR description, examining the diff, looking at surrounding files, and finally forming an opinion. Now I just:

1. Type `/pr-review.md` in chat
2. Paste in the PR number
3. Let Cline handle everything else

My workflow uses the `gh` command-line tool to:

-   Pull the PR description and comments
-   Examine the diff
-   Check surrounding files for context
-   Analyze potential issues
-   Asks me if it's cool approve it if everything looks good, with justification for why it should be approved
-   If I say "yes," Cline automatically approves the PR with the `gh` command

This has taken my PR review process from a manual, multi-step operation to a single command that gives me everything I need to make an informed decision.

## Building Your Own Workflows

The beauty of workflows is they're completely customizable to your needs. You might create workflows for all kinds of repetitive tasks:

-   For releases, you could have a workflow that grabs all merged PRs, builds a changelog, and handles version bumps.
-   Setting up new projects is perfect for workflows. Just run one command to create your folder structure, install dependencies, and set up configs.
-   Need to create a report? Create a workflow that grabs stats from different sources and formats them exactly how you like. You can even visualize them with a charting library and then make a presentation out of it with a library like [slidev](https://sli.dev/).
-   You can even use workflows to draft messages to your team using an MCP server like Slack or Whatsapp after you submit a PR.

With Workflows, your imagination is the limit. The true potential comes from spotting those annoying repetitive tasks you do all the time.

If you can describe something as "first I do X, then Y, then Z" - that's a perfect workflow candidate.

Start with something small that bugs you, turn it into a workflow, and keep refining it. You'll be shocked how much of your day can be automated this way.
