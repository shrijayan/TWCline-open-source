# TWCline Extension Memory Bank

## Project Context
TWCline is a VSCode extension forked from Cline, providing AI assistance through a combination of core extension backend and React-based webview frontend.

## Current Issue
Command registration mismatch after renaming extension from "cline" to "twcline"
- package.json declares commands with "twcline.*" prefix
- Source code still registers commands with "cline.*" prefix
- Results in "command not found" errors when buttons are clicked

## File Structure Analysis

### Core Files
- **package.json**: Already updated with twcline.* command declarations
- **src/extension.ts**: Main extension entry point, contains command registrations
- **src/core/webview/index.ts**: WebviewProvider with hardcoded IDs
- **src/core/commands.ts**: Additional command registrations

### Key Components Identified

#### src/extension.ts
- Contains vscode.commands.registerCommand calls using "cline.*" prefix
- Commands like: cline.plusButtonClicked, cline.accountButtonClicked, etc.
- Focus command references "claude-dev.SidebarProvider.focus"

#### src/core/webview/index.ts  
- WebviewProvider.sideBarId = "claude-dev.SidebarProvider"
- WebviewProvider.tabPanelId = "claude-dev.TabPanelProvider"
- These IDs must match package.json view declarations

#### src/core/commands.ts
- Contains additional command registrations with "cline.*" prefix
- Commands: cline.fileEditPresented, cline.fileEditAccepted, cline.fileEditRejected

## Fix Strategy
1. Update all command registrations from "cline.*" to "twcline.*"
2. Update WebviewProvider IDs from "claude-dev.*" to "twcline.*"
3. Update package.json view references to match new IDs
4. Search for any remaining hardcoded references

## Files Modified
1. **src/extension.ts** - Updated all command registrations from "cline.*" to "twcline.*"
2. **src/core/webview/index.ts** - Updated WebviewProvider IDs from "claude-dev.*" to "twcline.*"
3. **src/core/commands.ts** - Updated command registrations to use "twcline.*" prefix
4. **plan.md** - Tracked progress and marked tasks complete
5. **memoryBank.md** - Updated with implementation details

## Previous Issue Resolution: Command Registration Mismatch
The original "command 'twcline.accountButtonClicked' not found" error was caused by:
- package.json declared commands with "twcline.*" prefix
- Source code registered commands with "cline.*" prefix
- VSCode couldn't find the commands because of prefix mismatch

**Solution Implemented**: Systematically updated all command registrations and related references to use "twcline.*" prefix throughout the codebase, ensuring consistency between package.json declarations and actual command registrations.

## Current Issue: Statistics Button Missing from Accounts Page
**Problem**: User reports that the statistics button that was previously in the accounts page is no longer showing, but token statistics are visible in settings page.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Statistics button in AccountView.tsx is conditionally rendered only for logged-in users
- User wants all statistics consolidated in settings page instead of accounts page

**Solution Strategy**: 
- Move comprehensive statistics view from accounts page to settings page
- Create a "Statistics" button in settings that shows full statistics overlay
- Remove statistics functionality from accounts page

## New Implementation Plan: Statistics Migration

### Components Involved
1. **webview-ui/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx**
   - Main settings component where statistics button will be added
   - Needs state management for toggling between settings and statistics views

2. **webview-ui/src/components/account/StatisticsView.tsx**
   - Comprehensive statistics view with all metrics
   - Contains: Token usage, file edit suggestions, prompt quality, code commit stats
   - Will be reused from settings context instead of accounts context

3. **webview-ui/src/components/account/AccountView.tsx**
   - Currently has statistics button that needs to be removed
   - Contains ClineAccountView component with conditional statistics button

4. **webview-ui/src/components/settings/TokenUsageStatisticsSection.tsx**
   - Currently shows basic token usage stats in settings
   - May need to be integrated or replaced with comprehensive view

### Statistics Components Structure
- **StatisticsView.tsx**: Main comprehensive statistics view
  - Uses TokenUsageSection.tsx for token stats
  - Shows file edit statistics (total suggestions, acceptance rate)
  - Shows prompt quality metrics
  - Shows code commit stats (lines written, commit ratio)

- **TokenUsageSection.tsx**: Focused token usage component
  - Used within StatisticsView.tsx
  - Shows token counts, costs, most used models, cache efficiency

### Implementation Steps âœ… COMPLETED
1. âœ… Add statistics button and state management to SettingsView.tsx
2. âœ… Modify StatisticsView.tsx to work from settings context (reused existing component)
3. âœ… Remove statistics button from AccountView.tsx
4. ðŸ”„ Test comprehensive statistics integration

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made to SettingsView.tsx
- **Added imports**: StatisticsView from account components
- **Added state management**: `showStatistics` boolean state
- **Added conditional rendering**: Shows StatisticsView when `showStatistics` is true
- **Added Statistics section**: New section with description and "View Statistics" button
- **Removed**: TokenUsageStatisticsSection import (replaced by comprehensive statistics)
- **User Experience**: Clean transition between settings and statistics with back navigation

### Changes Made to AccountView.tsx
- **Removed**: StatisticsView import and related functionality
- **Removed**: `showStatistics` state management
- **Removed**: Statistics button from the account interface
- **Removed**: `onShowStatistics` prop and handler
- **Simplified**: Component focused solely on account management functions

### Statistics Flow Architecture
- **Settings Page**: Contains "View Statistics" button in dedicated Statistics section
- **StatisticsView**: Comprehensive statistics overlay from account components
  - Token Usage & Cost (via TokenUsageSection)
  - File Edit Suggestions & acceptance rates
  - Prompt Quality metrics 
  - Code Commit Stats & git tracking
- **Navigation**: Settings â†’ Statistics â†’ Back to Settings

## Files Modified in Current Session
