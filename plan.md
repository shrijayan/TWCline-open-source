# Statistics Loading Issue Fix - Task Plan

## Problem Description
The statistics page in the Cline extension was showing "Loading statistics data..." indefinitely without ever displaying the actual statistics data.

## Root Cause Analysis
- ✅ The `StatisticsView` component was sending a `fetchFileEditStatistics` message when it mounted
- ✅ The Controller had no handler for this message type, causing the request to be ignored
- ✅ The webview context was properly set up to handle the response but never received it
- ✅ Type mismatches between what the Controller was sending and what the webview expected

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Added Missing Message Handler in Controller ✅
- **File**: `src/core/controller/index.ts`
- **Change**: Added `fetchFileEditStatistics` case in `handleWebviewMessage` method
- **Purpose**: Responds to webview requests for statistics data

### 2. Updated ExtensionStateContext Interface ✅
- **File**: `webview-ui/src/context/ExtensionStateContext.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `fileEditStatistics: FileEditStatistics` to interface
- **Purpose**: Exposes statistics data to React components

### 3. Fixed Context Value Export ✅
- **File**: `webview-ui/src/context/ExtensionStateContext.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `fileEditStatistics` to the context value object
- **Purpose**: Makes statistics data accessible to components via useExtensionState hook

### 4. Updated Type Definitions ✅
- **File**: `src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts`
- **Change**: 
  - Imported `FileEditStatistics` type
  - Updated `fileEditStatistics` property to use full `FileEditStatistics` interface
- **Purpose**: Ensures type consistency across the extension

## Technical Details

### Message Flow
1. `StatisticsView` component mounts and sends `fetchFileEditStatistics` message
2. Controller receives message and retrieves statistics from global state
3. Controller sends `fileEditStatistics` message back to webview with complete data structure
4. ExtensionStateContext receives message and updates local state
5. StatisticsView accesses statistics via `useExtensionState()` hook and displays data

### Data Structure
The `FileEditStatistics` interface includes:
- `totalSuggestions`: Total file edit suggestions presented
- `acceptedSuggestions`: Number of suggestions accepted by user
- `promptQuality`: Average prompt quality score (optional)
- `totalLinesWritten`: Total lines written by Cline (optional)
- `totalLinesCommitted`: Total lines committed to git (optional)
- `commitRatio`: Percentage of written lines that were committed (optional)
- `lastCheckTimestamp`: When git commit stats were last checked (optional)

## Testing
- ✅ Compilation successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All type definitions properly imported and used
- ✅ Message handler correctly implemented in Controller

## Result
The statistics page should now properly load and display:
- File Edit Suggestions (total and acceptance rate)
- Prompt Quality (when available)
- Code Commit Stats (when available)

The infinite loading state has been resolved by establishing proper communication between the webview and extension backend.
